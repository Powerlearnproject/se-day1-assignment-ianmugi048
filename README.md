#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

-Software engineering is the development of efficient, budget-friendly computer programs within a short period of time to address and solve a real world problem. 
The importance in technology industry is that it ensures quality and reliability in software development through testing and debugging of the software whilst in development. 
It also supports automation in that enterprises and businesses use software to automate tasks hence increasing productivity.
It promotes teamwork. Through collaboration on platforms such as GitHub, developers can collaborate and exchange ideas with each other hence making more cutting-edge software.
It also enhances security as secure coding practices reduce risk of exploitable vulnerablities in software.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

-Birth of software engineering. This was crucial as enterprises were incurring such high costs in software development and poor planning leading to failed projects.  
-Rise of structured programming in 1970s. This through languages such as C which supported this paradigm which was mainly inclined to code structure and readability led to development of waterfall method of programming.
-Emergence of agile methodology. This was efficient for software development as it integrated customer feedback and release of small updates regularly unlike waterfall that required software to be fully developed before release. This posed a challenge in debugging as it required the whole program to be redeployed whenever modified. 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
-Requirements. User needs and project necessities are evaluated. 
-Planning. Resources required and time estimate are determined and a work plan developed.
-Design. Through flowcharts and pseudocode to ease the implementation in code.
-Implementation of the project through coding.
-Testing and debugging. The software is given test data with predictable outcome to run and its correctness determined and any bugs addressed.
-Deployment. It is released to its end users. 
-Maintenance and support. Ensuring that the software continues to work as expected as well as improving its functionality. 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

-Waterfall is rigid and changes are difficult to apply once a phase is done while agile is highly adaptable and a change can be applied at any stage.
-Waterfall follows a sequence and is structured while agile is itiretative with short continuous sprints of development.
-In waterfall, customer involvement after requirements phase is minimal while in agile, customer involvement in testing and feedback is crucial and maximized.
-In waterfall, testing is performed at the end of the SDLC while in agile, testing is continuous process.
-Waterfal projects are delivered as full program at the end while agile projects are delivered in short continuous sprints until the program is complete.
-Waterfall has extensive formal documentation while agile has little documentation as focus is on delivering working software.

USE CASES:
Waterfall; Government and defence projects, banking and finance software and construction software.
Agile; Mobile app development and E-commerce platforms.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer-Writes, tests and maintains the code while debugging and optimizing software performance.
Quality Assurance Engineer-Ensures standards are met before software is released and simulates test cases to identify bugs.
Project Manager-Manages budgets, timelines and oversees the entire development process.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDE:
-Boosts productivity by autocompleting, highlighting errors and providing debugging tools.
-Reduces error since it highlights errors and some have autocorrect syntax functionality.
-Code management as it organizes and formats and indents code improving readability and consistency.
-Integration as it supports extensions, plugins and frameworks. eg VSCode supports coderunner extension.
examples: VSCode, Pycharm, Eclipse.
VCS:
-Collaboration. A hub for collaboration with other developers is availed to users enabling them work as teams remotely. 
-Change Tracking.History of commits is stored and can be referenced to track changes to code.
-Branch and merge. Creation of branches before merging to main branch allows verification by repository owner and VCS to address any conflicts between the branches.
-Backup and recovery. In case of any unintended defect or modification, earlier versions of code can be restored.
examples: Git and Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-It is difficult to identify bugs and those identified late in the SDLC may be hard to debug. Solution is to use agile methodology with extensive documentation and clean code to easen tracing of errors.
-Version control conflicts as different program developers use different standards of coding. Solution is to use uniform coding standards and patterns.
-Handling software security issues as vulnerabilities in code can cause data breaches. Solution is to use secure coding practices.
-Balancing workload and burnout. Some programmers engage in marathons of code and late night and may get fatigue. Solution is to take breaks and have balanced work-life.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

-Unit testing tests individual components such as classes, modules and functions in isolation from the rest of the program. Its importance is it ensures small units of code work expectedly and catches bugs more easily.
-Integration testing tests interactions between multiple units. It ensures that combined modules can work correctly.
-System testing tests the whole program as a unit against the requirements. It identifies issues across the entire system before deployment.
-Acceptance testing is where end  users test the software to ensure it meets their demands. This ensures the software product is ready for real-world use.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

-Prompt engineering is the process of crafting input prompts fed to AI to get the most accurate results from AI models. 
It:
-Enhances response quality as well crafted input prompts are easy to understand and generate the most specific output.
-Improves efficiency as it reduces need for clarifying severally to the AI model ensuring accurate results are obtained faster.
-Controls AI behaviour and biases as it guides AI towards ethics and unbiased responses by careful issuing of prompts.
-Optimizes AI for specific use cases such as chatbots like chatgpt and copilot that can interact with humans as persons and offer assistance.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Tell me about physics. The prompt is vague as physics is a vast field that would require countless lines of output to explain and as a result the AI model would most likely ask you to clarify on what part you wish to know about or just give an overview definition of the same. 
It could be made better by saying for example, "Compare and contrast stationary and progressive waves, giving examples in each case" would yield a much clearer response as it has narrowed down to a specific part of physics thar is "waves". The AI model would define the two, give similarities between the two, differences as well as examples of such waves and their application in real life such as microwaves, radiowaves etc.
